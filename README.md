# Patrick's Web Archive

[https://webarchive.hopeph.com](https://webarchive.hopeph.com/)

Welcome to my personal *Wayback Machine* where I store for posterity my favorite articles from around the web. That's right. The full web page is saved here because millions of links and websites are lost to the digital sands of time every day. I will share here the best online reads I gather for every month of every year.

*The original URLs are below each article title to credit the sources.*

If you're curious, I use [*Tiny Tiny RSS*](https://tt-rss.org/), [*Pocket*](https://www.getpocket.com/) and [*Telegram*](https://telegram.org/) to help me collect these links. I save the webpages themselves using the browser extension [*SingleFile*](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/). I use [*mdBook*](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) for this archive site. These pages are hosted in *GitHub*, for now.

Happy reading!
